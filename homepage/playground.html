    <h1>My Blue and Green Playground</h1>
    <img alt="My Blue and Green Playground" src="playgroundimg.jpg" width="700" height="500" class="center">
    <p> My earliest memories, I was someone else. Too young to know who I really was or what I wanted to be, but old enough to pretend I was something that I wasnâ€™t. Old enough to watch, to imitate. Still malleable with age and bright with innocence. There were times I forgot I was being watched, free to act and play however I wanted. When I was there, I spoke like the people I saw on tv, I acted like the characters in the movies I liked. When I was there I lied about who I was because my imagination still allowed me to do so. I saw things that other people couldn't see, I learned things that they would never teach us in school, I dreamt of the times I would get to go back, hoping that maybe one day my mom would forget me and that I would be able to stay forever.</p>
    <p>There was no place like it. The sheer size was incredible. In my earliest memories everything was too tall for me, too big, or too far. But that's how I liked it. That's how I loved it. I loved the ground with the blue and green rubber tiles I had named it after. No matter how dirty people told me it was or how many times people told me to get up, I loved to roll, to crawl, to throw myself on it in fits of laughter and joy. I loved the slide that roared like thunder when you kicked it, the same one that burned your uncovered skin on the hottest days. I loved the gigantic spider web of rope and the way the wind rushed through my braids on autumn afternoons.</p>
    <p>I remember the days I spent running. Running around, answering to a name that wasn't my own. Running through a world that only I could see. Laughing and yelling as if my entire world was encased in that metal fence. Back then it was. And in that metal fence I made a world with my mind. I would get good at that. </p>
    <p>I remember falling. Skinning my knee, bleeding onto the pavement, barely being able to stand. I remember wanting to cry so badly, wanting to stay on the ground and cradle my leg in my little hands. I remember wanting to cry but smiling instead, giving a shaky thumbs-up to the concerned eyes that watched me tumble. And as I stood up and took my first steps, it was as if I was born again, only momentarily knocked out of character. With tears drying on my face, I was running once more, unfazed and ready to start anew. I would get good at that. </p>
    <p>I remember looking up to the very top of the play equipment, imagining what it would be like to be that tall, to sit on top of the world. And despite my overactive imagination, I could never quite fathom what that could possibly be like. Or at least not accurately.</p>
    <p>In my latest memory, I was someone else too. Trying too hard to be something I was not, caring too much about what others thought. Too young to know who I really was but old enough to know exactly who I wanted to be. My insecurities visible even in the cold, darkness of night and the fear in my eyes shining brightly under the streetlights. Sitting on top of the world, there was no running from myself. Sitting on top of the world, it was far less impressive than I thought it would be.</p>
    <p>I walk by there a lot. I remember a lot. Sometimes I watch and listen. I think of what I would give to play so easily, to run so freely once again. What I would give to not care who watched me, to feel confident, to feel so unvexed once more. What I would give to go back to the days when I truly believed I would never outgrow my world. But now I know, my blue and green playground is less of a world than it is a ghost of my imagination.</p>
